# Turnstile

This is really just an exercise repo.
I realized I haven't thought about State Machines in a while. 
It seems like it would be a good opportunity to use Elixir and OTP, specifically. 

### Goals

* Drive all implementation with tests
* Play around with using a GenServer
* Think a little about State Machines (and [read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) up on them)
* Think a bit about state and state management in Elixir and OTP
